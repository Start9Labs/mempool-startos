alerts:
  start: |
    READ CAREFULLY! When first running Mempool, previous block fee estimates will show as zero values until the service is able to catch up. This is expected behaviour.
    ALSO: Lookups may be slow or time out altogether while the service is still warming up, or if there are too many other things running on your system. If address lookups aren't working, try restarting electrs and try the lookup again.
